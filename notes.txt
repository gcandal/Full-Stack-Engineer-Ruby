Features:
- React + Redux + ES6 + Grape
- Grape acts as middleware

Missing:
- Caching: client side (comics), server side (requests to Marvel's API such as (character name, id) mapping with suitable database such as Redis)
- Client side network requests' error handling
- Serve (cached) covers with reduced size instead of using Marvel's source directly
- Sprites (not as important as it used to be, due to HTTP 2's server push)
- Favorite comics discriminated by account
- Use URL as a mechanism to perform a specific search
- Tests :(
