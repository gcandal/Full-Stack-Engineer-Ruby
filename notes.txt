Features:
- React + Redux + ES6 + Grape
- Grape acts as middleware

Missing:
- Client side caching
- Client side network requests' error handling
- Character name <-> id mapping with suitable database such as Redis
- Serve covers with reduced size instead of using Marvel's source directly
- Sprites (not as important as it used to be, due to HTTP 2's server push)
- Favorite comics discriminated by account
- Tests :(
